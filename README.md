# BTCPay client library for Dart

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/btcpay_client.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/btcpay_client)

This client takes care of communications to a BTCPay server. This is heavily
dependent on PointyCastle but eschews reflection so it can be used in Flutter.

## Tests

```
$ pub run test
```

## Getting Started

See the `example` directory or the [Kolibri app](https://github.com/Feathercoin-Foundation/kolibri) to learn how to use this library.
